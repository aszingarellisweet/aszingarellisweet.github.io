I'm delighted to have [a guest post](https://unifiedlibraryscene.blogspot.com/2017/05/you-see-there-are-two-kinda-people-in.html) up today on Constructive Summer: Building the Unified Library Scene! Thanks so much to Erin and Rachel for providing me this venue to share some thoughts about geolocation, linked data services, and protecting user privacy.
