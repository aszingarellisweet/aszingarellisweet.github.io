Iâ€™m a special formats cataloger with expertise in Classical and Romance languages and the fine arts. My current research interests focus on transforming MARC, the climate impacts of data, and sustainable and decolonized knowledge infrastructures. I live in Los Angeles with my wife and our scrappy terrier mutt, and I enjoy native gardening, detective novels, and killing it at pub trivia.
