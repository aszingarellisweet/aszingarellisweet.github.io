Iâ€™m a special collections cataloger with expertise in Classical and Romance languages and the fine arts. My current research focuses on the history of knowledge infrastructures, transforming MARC, and the climate impacts of library data. I live in Los Angeles with my wife and our elderly cocker spaniel, and I enjoy native gardening, tacos, and killing it at pub trivia.
