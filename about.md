I am a cataloging librarian with expertise in the fine arts, special formats, and Classical and Romance languages. I'm dedicated to developing and maintaining more efficient, sustainable, meaningful, and just knowledge infrastructures to continue connecting people with cultural heritage resources in a rapidly changing world. My interests include transforming MARC, evaluating the climate impacts of library data, and related applications of minimal computing. I live in Rochester, NY, with my wife and our scrappy terrier mutt, and I enjoy lower peak hiking, detective novels, and killing it at pub trivia.

Everything you'll find herein is my own opinion and does not represent my employer or any other organization I am affiliated with.
