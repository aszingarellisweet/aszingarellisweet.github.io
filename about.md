Iâ€™m a special formats cataloger with expertise in Classical and Romance languages and the fine arts. My current research interests focus on transforming MARC, evaulating climate impacts of library data, and decolonizing knowledge infrastructures. I live in Los Angeles with my wife and our elderly cocker spaniel, and I enjoy native gardening, Memphis soul, and killing it at pub trivia.
