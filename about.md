I am a special formats cataloger with expertise in Classical and Romance languages and the fine arts. I'm dedicated to developing and maintaining more efficient, sustainable, meaningful, and just knowledge infrastructures to continue connecting people with cultural heritage resources in a rapidly changing world. My interests include transforming MARC, evaluating the climate impacts of library data, and related applications of minimal computing. I live in Los Angeles with my wife and our scrappy terrier mutt, and I enjoy lower peak hiking, detective novels, and killing it at pub trivia.
